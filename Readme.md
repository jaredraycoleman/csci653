# Improving the Wfchef Pattern Detection and Replication Algorithms
Our goal is to re-implement the Wfchef workflow pattern detection and replication algorithms [1]  (part of the larger [Wfcommons](https://github.com/wfcommons/wfcommons) framework) as divide and conquer algorithms so that the tool can be used to detect patterns and generate realistic synthetic workflows for larger applications.

## Preliminary Results
This work presents an algorithm that attempts to find all patterns in a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) simultaneously in one pass. We start with a DAG that represents an application, or a scientific workflow, and rather than flooding on every pair of nodes that have the same typehash (see definition in [1]) as it is done in wfChef, our goal is to find all the patterns comparing the nodes only once in the top-down pass through the graph to eliminate the redundant computation, and divide the work to be computed in parallel for speed-up purposes. 

Figure 1 shows our preliminary results of the speedup possible with this kind of one-pass algorithm for 7 different applications: 1000genome, Cycles, Epigenomics, Montage, Seismology, Soykb and Srasearch.

We have not yet succeeded in finding an algorithm of this form. Our most recent efforts find all patterns, but also find many false positives. The next step is to perform a speed analysis for single-CPU and parallel computing set-ups.
