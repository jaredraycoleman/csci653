# Improving the Wfchef Pattern Detection and Replication Algorithms
Our goal is to re-implement the Wfchef workflow pattern detection and replication algorithms [1]  (part of the larger [Wfcommons](https://github.com/wfcommons/wfcommons) framework) as divide and conquer algorithms so that the tool can be used to detect patterns and generate realistic synthetic workflows for larger applications.
